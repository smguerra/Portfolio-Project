## Description 

This Portfolio Project showcases my skills and talents in the development of web applications. it starts with information about me, and links to direct the user towards my work and my contact details. Users can see my work clicking on the images or tittles of each of the web applications which will taken them to that deployed application. In this portfolio project I have made use of grid lay out to create the structure of the web application and also I have made use of media queries to make its layout responsive so it adapts to varios screens and devices.
